Integrity
=========

Integrity is your friendly automated Continuous Integration server.

It's fully usable from within its web interface (backed by [Sinatra][]),
allowing you to add a project, set preferences for it (where's the code
repository, is it completely private or public, etc), and run the build command
from there.

It has been designed with ruby projects in mind, but any project that can be
tested in an unix-y fashion (with a command line tool that returns 0 on success
and non-zero on failure) works with it.

Getting Started
===============

Install the `integrity` gem from GitHub:

    gem sources --add http://gems.github.com
    sudo gem install foca-integrity

In order to setup Integrity, run the following command:

    integrity install /path/to/my/app

Then browse to /path/to/my/app and edit the config files at your convenience.
The default configuration should be "good enough" in most cases, so you should
be pretty much ready to rock.

For deployment, we recommend [Thin][]. Provided with Integrity comes a thin.yml
file, so all you need to do after running `integrity install` should be

    thin -C /path/to/my/app/thin.yml -R /path/to/my/app/config.ru start

And you should be up and running.

If you want automatic commit processing, you currently need to be using
[GitHub][]. Click the edit link on your GitHub project, and add an integrity
link that looks like the following to the `Post-Receive URL` field:

    http://integrity.domain.tld/projectname/push

Receiving Notifications
=======================

If you want to be notified after each build, you need to install our notifiers.
For example, in order to receive an email after each build, install:

    sudo gem install foca-integrity-email

And then edit `/path/to/my/app/config.ru` and add:

    require "notifier/email"

After all the `require` lines.

Available notifiers
-------------------

* [Mail](http://github.com/foca/integrity-email)
* [Jabber](http://github.com/ph/integrity-jabber)
* [Campfire](http://github.com/defunkt/integrity-campfire)

Resources
========

We have a [Lighthouse account][lighthouse] where you can submit patches or
feature requests. Also, someone is usually around [#integrity][irc-channel] on
Freenode, so don't hesitate to stop by for ideas, help, patches or something.

Future plans
============

* [Twitter][]/[IRC][]/etc bots
* A sample generic post-receive-hook so you can run this from any git repo
* Better integration with GitHub

Development
===========

The code is stored in [GitHub][repo]. Feel free to fork, play with it, and send
a pull request afterwards. 

In order to run the test suite you'll need a few more gems: [rspec][], [rcov][]
and [hpricot][]. With that installed running `rake` will run the specs and
ensure the code coverage stays high.
